❓ PROMPT
Given a non-negative int n, compute recursively (no loops) the number of occurrences of 8 as a digit,
except that an 8 with another 8 immediately to its left counts double, so 8818 yields 4 (because 2+1+0+1).

Note that mod (%) by 10 yields the rightmost digit (126 % 10 is 6), while dividing (/)
by 10 removes the rightmost digit (126 / 10 is 12).

Example(s)
count8(8) == 1
count8(818) == 2
count8(8818) == 4  (because 2+1+0+1)
