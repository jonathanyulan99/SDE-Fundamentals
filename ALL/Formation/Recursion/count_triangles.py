❓ PROMPT
We have a triangle made of blocks. The topmost row has 1 block, the next row down has 2 blocks, the next row has 3 blocks, 
and so on. Compute recursively (no loops or multiplication) the total number of blocks in such a triangle with the given 
number of rows.

Example(s)
triangle(2) == 3
triangle(3) == 6
triangle(5) == 15
