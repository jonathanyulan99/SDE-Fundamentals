'''Let's define a group of anagrams as a list of words, where each group shares the same anagram.

Anagram means you can rearrange the letters to form any other word in the group 
(eg: tea could be transformed into eat).

Given a list of words, split it into the smallest possible number of groups of anagrams 
and return this number as the answer.'''
